The “Cloud Lab” expansion also allowed for something novel - the ability for players to propose their own experiments, which was done throughout the lifetime of the Cloud Lab.

With the ability to test thousands of players’ designs for RNA switch puzzles at a time, Eterna players began to tackle some of their hardest challenges yet: building RNA computers. And this time, instead of small molecules, players would be attempting to bind oligonucleotides (oligos), small pieces of RNA or DNA. Eterna players quickly demonstrated their ability to design logic gates and ratiometric calculators using RNA binding to multiple oligos.",
  "history:science-body-15": "The testing of multi-state RNAs on the RNA Array was perfect preparation for Eterna’s first medically-relevant challenges, OpenTB, aiming to create a fast, low-cost, easily-deployable diagnostic for tuberculosis, one of the world’s largest public health crises, and OpenCRISPR, aiming to create designs which would improve the safety of the CRISPR gene editing technology by allowing it to be turned on and off on demand. IN 2017, the OpenTB project led to successful RNA calculator molecules, which Stanford will patent with Eterna players as named co-inventors. The Das Laboratory is testing these molecules in real-world diagnostic devices. And in 2018, Eterna returned to more basic research in riboswitch design, exploring designing RNA switches using new types of small molecules.",
  "history:science-body-16": "In 2019, Eterna piloted our next major project, the Ribosome Challenge: Players were challenged to stabilize the ribosome to allow for further work in ribosome engineering, including the ability to develop novel materials that are costly or impossible to produce by other methods. Because this project presented a novel challenge in designing significantly longer strands of RNA, players were given added information during the design to suggest which molecular areas were best to mutate given scientific knowledge of existing ribosomes that evolved in bacteria and how some mutations impact ribosome function, based on experimental results from the lab of collaborator Dr. Michael Jewett (Northwestern University).",

Switching back and forth between target and natural modes will then tell you what is going wrong.<newline><newline>Bases with a black key symbol are locked and cannot be changed.<newline><newline>Leave loops <yellow>yellow</yellow> except when painting boosts.\n",
  "help:four-bases-text": "Bases (also called nucleotides) are the building blocks of RNA. Each circle on VirtuaLab's RNA molecules represents one base.<newline><newline>The four bases are <yellow>Adenine (A)</yellow>, <blue>Uracil (U)</blue>, <red>Guanine (G)</red>, and <green>Cytosine (C)</green>. Select bases from the palette and click (or click and drag) the circles on the RNA. The sequence of nucleotide bases determines how RNA will fold.\n",
  "help:moving-and-magnifying-RNA-text": "To move an RNA molecule around the screen, click and drag the background (the blue area with bubbles behind the RNA).<newline><newline>You can zoom in and out using the magnifying glass buttons at the bottom of the screen.\n",
  "help:objectives-text": "The boxes in the upper left corner of the screen show your mission objectives. In order to solve a puzzle, you must turn all of these boxes green by meeting their requirements.<newline><newline>The objectives change based on natural mode, not target mode. So, if you paint an <yellow>A</yellow>-<blue>U</blue> bond in target mode, the objective may not count it until the <yellow>A</yellow>-<blue>U</blue> bonds correctly in natural mode.\n<newline> \n",
  "help:click-and-drag-painting-text": "Click on the first base you want to change. Then, holding down the mouse button, drag the cursor over all of the bases you want to change.\n",
  "help:bonds-text": "The three bonds are:<newline><yellow>A</yellow>-<blue>U</blue><newline><blue>U</blue>-<red>G</red><newline><red>G</red>-<green>C</green><newline><newline>Bonded bases are next to each other in the palette.\n",
  "help:stacks-and-loops-text": "Stacks are lines of bonded bases.<newline><newline>Loops are circular and made of unbonded bases.\n",
  "help:painting-pairs-of-bases-text": "The buttons below the bases on the palette allow you to paint two bonded colors at the same time onto stacks.\n",
  "help:bond-strength-text": "<red>G</red>-<green>C</green> is the strongest bond<newline><yellow>A</yellow>-<blue>U</blue> is medium<newline><blue>U</blue>-<red>G</red> is weakest\n",
  "help:natural-and-target-modes-text": "Target mode (target button) shows the shape you want to fold the RNA into. Natural mode (leaf button) shows how the RNA will actually fold based on how you've painted it.<newline><newline>Switching back and forth between these two modes can help you see where an RNA isn't folding correctly.\n",
  "help:end-of-stacks-text": "The ends of stacks, where they meet loops, are the weakest points in an RNA. They usually need strong bonds to hold them together. Placing <red>G</red>-<green>C</green>s at the ends of stacks is a good strategy for starting puzzles.<newline><newline>Some puzzles will restrict the number of <red>G</red>-<green>C</green>s that you can use. In those cases, it's often best to place <yellow>A</yellow>-<blue>U</blue>s at the ends of stacks instead.\n",
  "help:shape-guide-text": "The shape guide is the box at the top left part of the screen that shows the shape that you need to fold an RNA into. You can click on this box to see a larger version of it. Red areas are incorrect, and white areas are folding correctly. The shape guide turns green when all parts of the molecule have folded correctly.<newline><newline>Use the shape guide to figure out where you need to work on a molecule in order to get it to fold correctly.\n",
  "help:placing-A-U-text": "<yellow>A</yellow>-<blue>U</blue> bonds are of medium strength. They're good at holding the middle of stacks together. They can sometimes hold the ends of stacks together (however, <red>G</red>-<green>C</green> is better at that).<newline><newline><yellow>A</yellow>-<blue>U</blue>s are strongest when they “zipper,“ or alternate in direction.\n",
  "help:slides-text": "Bonds can slide to the wrong bases when each side of a stack is one color. Sometimes, entire sections of an RNA will slide to each other, giving the RNA the wrong shape.<newline><newline>Fix slides by using the swap tool (the button to the right of the palette).\n",
  "help:swap-tool-text": "The swap tool is the button to the right of the palette. It swaps the positions of two bases across from each other in a stack.\n",
  "help:placing-U-G-text": "<blue>U</blue>-<red>G</red> is the weakest bond. It often works in the middle of stacks and next to <red>G</red>-<green>C</green> bonds. When you must use <blue>U</blue>-<red>G</red> bonds, first stabilize the entire puzzle with <red>G</red>-<green>C</green> and/or <yellow>A</yellow>-<blue>U</blue> bonds. The target map will have a green check mark when the puzzle has been stabilized. Next, place <blue>U</blue>-<red>G</red> bonds one at a time in the middle of stacks, spacing them apart from each other. Check the target map after placing every <blue>U</blue>-<red>G</red>; if it turns red, undo that last bond and try again somewhere else.<newline><newline>When you place multiple <blue>U</blue>-<red>G</red>s in a row, they're stronger if they all go in the same direction, with blues on one side and reds on the other.\n",
  "help:boosting-loops-text": "Loops can be strengthened using boosts. The most common loop boost is placing a <red>G</red> at the lowest numbered base next to a stack. There must be an unbonded <yellow>A</yellow> across the stack. Even though it isn't pictured, the <red>G</red> and <yellow>A</yellow> actually form a weak bond; the loop holds them far enough apart to make this possible.<newline><newline>A loop can usually be boosted multiple times if it has more than one stack coming out of it.\n",
  "help:base-numbers-text": "The numbers next to the RNA count bases from the top of a strand to the bottom (when it is unpainted in natural mode). When RNA folds up, the numbers stay next to the same bases.\n",
  "help:bulges-text": "Bulges are loops that always have exactly two adjacent stacks and one or more unbonded bases.<newline><newline>Bulges cannot be boosted.\n",
  "help:1-1-loops-text": "Loops that have one loose nucleotide on each side are called 1-1 loops. They always have two stacks coming out at opposite sides. You can boost 1-1 loops by placing <red>G</red>s on the two unbonded bases. These <red>G</red>s strengthen the loop because they bond to each other. <red>G</red>s rarely bond; here, the 1-1 loop happens to hold them apart from each other at just the right distance to make this possible.\n",
  "help:energy-text": "RNA folds into the state with the lowest energy. A loop with energy of -1 is more likely to fold than a loop with an energy of 2.<newline><newline>Energy is a powerful tool: it lets you see how your choices help the RNA fold.<newline><newline>Remember, negative numbers are better for an RNA. The colors are a helpful reminder - <green>green</green> numbers are strong, and <red>red</red> numbers are weak.<newline><newline>Energy only appears after you paint bonds.\n",
  "help:switch-puzzles-text": "Switch puzzles fold into two different shapes. Switch RNAs change shape when they capture a molecule. However, the sequence of bases doesn't change. The challenge with these puzzles is to design a sequence of bases that works for both shapes.<newline><newline>Click the toggle above the natural/target mode buttons to switch between the two shapes (this toggle only appears on switch levels). The highlighting base tool is extremely useful when solving switch puzzles.\n",
  "help:highlighting-bases-text": "Highlight specific bases by right-clicking them (command-click on a Mac). This will place a black circle around the base. This black circle stays on that base in natural mode and target mode and for both states of a switch puzzle. It's a useful tool when you're trying to understand which bases are stopping an RNA from folding correctly.\n",
