    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>
      The following provides information on information we collect when viewing the Websites and
      how we handle it. We recognize this is an important responsibility, and aim to be as
      transparent as possible.
    </p>

    <h4>Personal Information We Collect</h4>
    <p>
      "Personal Information" is any information about one of our Users which could, alone or
      together with other information, personally identify them or otherwise be reasonably linked
      or connected with them. Information such as a username and password, an email address, a real
      name, an Internet protocol (IP) address, and a photograph are examples of
      "Personal Information."
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information that
      does not identify a User or cannot otherwise be reasonably linked or connected with them. We
      may use such aggregated, non-personally identifying information for research purposes and to
      operate, analyze, improve, and optimize our Websites.
    </p>
    <h5>Account Credentials</h5>
    <p>
      A username and password are provided on account registration. This is necessary to
      authenticate your account, and the username is used to identify you throughout the site and
      in other communications such as providing attribution in research publications, presentations,
      or publicity. Your password may be changed at any time through your user profile, and your
      username may be changed in some situations by contacting <a href="mailto:support@eternagame.org">support@eternagame.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also opt to authenticate your account via third-party providers such as social
      networks. We will collect the necessary identifiers or tokens necessary to authenticate your
      account with the relevant provider. We may request information such as email, name, and
      profile picture from the third party to expedite creation of your account, and in some cases
      keep it in sync with the third-party provider.
    </p>
    <h5>Email</h5>
    <p>
      A valid email address is required on account registration in order to provide necessary
      account functions such as verification and password resets. Eterna staff may in rare
      situations use this email to directly contact a user with respect to their account or usage
      of the Eterna Websites, particularly when contact by methods such as in-game messaging are
      insufficient. Eterna may also send emails relating to notifications, project updates, or other
      similar information based on your preferences. Your email and contact preferences may be
      changed at any time through your user profile.
    </p>
    <h5>Personal Name</h5>
    <p>
      A personal name may be optionally provided (and updated at any time) through your user
      profile. This is used for attribution in your autogenerated player certificate as well as
      instead of or in addition to your username in research publications.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also otherwise opt to allow use of your name to publicly thank participants, such as
      in publications and presentations.
    </p>
    <h5>IP Address</h5>
    <p>
      Your IP address is a necessary piece of information to provide our content to you - without
      it, we would have no way of providing you our content. In addition to such usage, we may also
      retain IP addresses in abuse prevention systems (such as for rate limiting) and transient logs
      (to detect or troubleshoot potential abuse or other problems).
    </p>
    <h5>User Generated Content</h5>
    <p>
      Any Personal Information you post to your user profile, forums, chat, comments, or other
      similar areas of the website, is public. You are responsible for any information you post in
      such locations.
    </p>

    <h4>Cookie Policy</h4>
    <p>
      A cookie is a file designed to contain a small amount of user and website information stored
      on a user's computer. The file interacts with the user and the website to provide a webpage

    <h4>How We Share Information We Collect</h4>
    <p>
      We do not sell your Personal Information for monetary or other consideration. We may share
      your Personal Information with third parties under one of the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <h5>With Your Consent</h5>
    <p>
      We share your Personal Information, if you consent, after letting you know what information
      will be shared, with whom, and why.
    </p>
    <h5>With Service Providers</h5>
    <p>
      We share Personal Information with a limited number of service providers who process it on our
      behalf to provide or improve our Websites. For example, we must necessarily transmit and store
      your data via our cloud service provider.
    </p>
    <h5>Under Strict Limitations With Limited Partners</h5>
    <p>
      As part of our partnership with <a href="https://scistarter.org/">SciStarter</a>, certain
      contributions are reported so that if you are a SciStarter member, they can appear on your
      profile. This report includes the contributor's (sha256) hashed email address. The use of a
      cryptographic hash ensures that SciStarter (or anyone else) cannot connect that hash to a
      specific person or a specific email address, unless the email address is already known (ie,
      you have previously signed up for SciStarter).
    </p>
    <h5>For Legal Disclosure</h5>
    <p>
      Unless prevented from doing so by law or court order, or in rare, exigent circumstances, we
      make a reasonable effort to notify users of any legally compelled or required disclosure of
      their information. Eterna may disclose Personal Information or other information we collect
      about you to law enforcement if required in response to a valid subpoena, court order, search
      warrant, a similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is
      necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to protect our property or rights, or those of
      third parties or the public at large.
    </p>
    <h5>Change in Control</h5>
    <p>
      We may share Personal Information if control of Eterna is moved to another institution. If any
      such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the
      confidentiality of Personal Information.
    </p>

    <h4>Information Security</h4>
    <p>
      Eterna takes the security of your personal information seriously. No method of transmission,
      or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure nor can any process or software be guaranteed
      to be free from error. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. However, we take
      thorough measures to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or
      destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of Personal Information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eterna strives to ensure our systems and software follow security best practices, including
      patching, configuration, access controls, credential management, and encryption where appropriate.
    </p>

    <h4 id="data-rights-and-retention">Data Rights and Retention</h4>
    <p>
      Should you need any additional assistance to employ your rights, such as under the General
      Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and such tools are not readily available to you,
      contact <a href="mailto:support@eternagame.org">support@eternagame.org</a> for assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Account deletion requests will be honored, and will result in the removal of profile
      information including account credentials, email, and personal name. User Contributions will
      still be preserved, but their attribution will be anonymized. We cannot retroactively remove
      information such as username or personal name from published research.
