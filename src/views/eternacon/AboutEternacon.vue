      <h3 class="mt-2">What is Eternacon?</h3>
      <p>
        First hosted at Stanford University in 2015, Eternacon is a gathering of Eterna players, scientists,
        developers, and other experts in fields important to Eterna. Originally only a dream among players as an
        "Eterna Convention", Eternacon was fully realized by tomoedachii and vineetkosaraju, who put together a plan
        that would allow for the first conference in 2015. In the past, the conference has included many different
        talks by participants about puzzle solving, scientific advancements, the community, and the future of Eterna
        as a whole, a tour of the lab, open discussion about the current state of eterna with the oppotrunity to make
        suggestions to the team, and the chance to get to know fellow Eterna players.
